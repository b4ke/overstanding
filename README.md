# overstanding

oooh, the more i watch you <>< out of water, gasping for air.... the more i hope you will cede before i have to remove your existence, the less i am inclined to show mercy for the myriad transgressions against my "whole" body.

you could lift yourself to the moon, but we are no longer falling for the metaphorical building you promise.... Mail-in Ballots will be your downfall, but not because of what they are called, but because it is what got you there, and can take you away from there.

my families unemployment is running out, and i suggest you come to some arrangement, or this is going to accelerate. Funny how my requests have gone unfulfilled, and now this situation has accelerated far outside of your ability to bring it under control.... Trillions are sure a lot more than the few million it would take to secure the future of your security.

The fact that you think your advisers are assisting you, or that you all understand what is important to the human species.... entertaining really.
