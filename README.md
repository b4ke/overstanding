i do find it entertaining that the closer we get to the vote regarding the "conference" tomorrow, the more conservative my wife seems to be getting.... i wonder if they've realized yet that they are going to get no ground on that arch, or that attempting to do so is exactly as desired to undermine their foundational pour. I hope you check this every day, and I know you think your silly games are going to help you.... thank you for the laughs, don.
