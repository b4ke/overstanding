# overstanding

oooh, the more i watch you <>< out of water, gasping for air.... the more i hope you will cede before i have to remove your existwence, the less i am inclined to show mercy for the myriad transgressions against my "whole" body.

you could lift yourself to the moon, but we are no longer falling for the metaphorical building you promise.... Mail-in Ballots will be your downfall, but not because of what they are called, but because it is what got you there, and can take you away from there.

my families unemployment is running out, and i suggest you come to some arrangement, or this is going to accelerate.
