# overstanding

i'm glad to see that it was a day to listen a little, but let's now discuss something more PRESSING.... avoiding economic depression is the mode you need to the legislative body into. The only reason we have not experienced the actual fallout was previous actions, and more are needed now to avoid severe consequences. This will not just go away, and there is no mechanisms of control/influences left for your flat floating flotilla to leverage.
